for each packet filtered q1, i.e http request to Webserver infosec17,we send back our response :
in the ip layer,we just reverse src_ip and dst_ip. same in tcp ports.
we also want to close connection so we put "FA" flag to close the TCPcon.
seq number should be the ack number in the last received packet (as defined in TCP protocol)
ack number should be seq_number + length of TCP_payload.
finally, the content of httpPayload should be exactly - RESPONE : 302 redirection to facebook site
